<h3>Objects</h3>
<p>Objects are variables. However, unlike variables they are able to contain a multitude of values. These containers that have named values are also called methods or properties. While you don't have to always use the keyword "new", it is necessary when doing more complex methods. An object literal is list of nam-value pairs within the curly brackets of the object. It looks very similar to how you would code CSS the only difference being you would have "var Object = {}" instead of "object {}". Objects don't exist in CSS but that's just what I thought of.</p>
<p>Javascript constructors are used when you need to create more than just one object. In these cases a constructor acts as a blueprint to create many objects of the same "type". Just like with creatin new objects, constructors also use the keyword "new". We also use the constructor function "this" as a replacement for the new object. "this" becomes he object when it is created. "this" is now a keyword instead of a variable and therefore cannot have its value changed. These constructors are used when an object is created with a class.</p>
