<h3>Mitt Romney Web Font Problem</h3>
<p>Full disclosure I'm not fully understanding all the vocabulary used in this article but I understand the general principle. So the problem was that when Slate.com announced that Mitt Romney was not running for president in 2016, the headline had the use of two different fonts as well as combining bold and italics. Something caused this to not initially show the word "not" in the headline "Mitt Romney is Officially Not Running for President." This obviously caused a bit of confusion and people not knowing it was a type dismissed this website as not credible. I can't imagine this harmed Mitt Romney very much but it was detrimental to the website that published this article because now they are perceived as not having accurate information. This could've happened in any arena, not just politics. Imagine an article titled "Google CEO is not resigning" but missing the not just like in Mitt Romney's case. This would affect the economy, people would start selling stocks, misinformation would be spread, etc. This is why it's important to test everything you make and on multiple browsers and mobile. The article recommends some complex soutions to avoiding this issue but I personally feel like it would be better to just change it to a font that doesn't have that issue or just don't bold and italicize the word. This feels like an easily avoidable problem but a good example on how one little mistake can make a huge difference.</p>
