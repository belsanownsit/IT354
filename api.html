<p>APIs stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is what sends requests to a database or server and returns back a response. This can range from a weather forecast, to a list of jobs, to sports statistics, etc. The list goes on and on because APIs are involved in almost every website we use these days. These websites use APIs because they only have direct access to their own data. So if their website requires information that another website or application has, they must use an API in order to request that dataset and recieve it.</p>
<h3>REST</h3>
<p>REST is an acronym that stands for Representation State Transfer. Simply put - A server responds to create, read, update, and delete requests in a standard way. REST treats all server URLs as access points for various resources on the server. The 4 actions for RESTful APIs are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.</p>
<ul>
    <li>GET</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Gets a list of the resource</li>
        <li>Acts on the entire resource or a singular one</li>
    </ul>
    <li>POST</li>
    <UL>
        <li>Used to create a new resource</li>
        <li>Acts on the entire resource</li>
    </UL>
    <li>PUT</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Updates the resource with the given ID</li>
        <li>Acts on a single resource</li>
    </ul>
    <li>DELETE</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Deletes the resource with the given ID</li>
        <li>Acts on a single resource</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Postman</h3>
<p>Postman is instrumental in the use of APIs because it allows you to test the functionality of an API without having to write a bunch of code just to see if it works. It also has a very simple yet efficient UI that is very beginner friendly to people such as myself. It also converts the API code into a much easier to read JSON format that makes it possible to troubleshoot and understand it a lot better. Overall Postman just makes life easier when you are working with APIs.</p>
<h3>API Example</h3>
<p>The screenshot is of a code snippet that allows us to access a Pokemon based API. This API is a database of all the Pokemon in every videogame as well as all of its statistics. With this code specifically we are able to retrieve the Pokemon's id number as well as its height and weight.</p>
