<h3>Microservices vs Monolith: which architecture is the best choice for your business?</h3>
<p>This article did a good job of explaining to an uneducated user like me what these two terms are and how they differ. I would've preferred some real life examples of each as it is hard to picture what each approach would actually look like. The impression I got from this article is that microservice is superior to monolith and the only reason someone would use monolith is if they are very inexperienced and their app is small.</p>
<h3>Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture(MuleSoft)</h3>
<p>This article is fairly similar to the previous one with the exception that they say that microservices should be kept to a small team instead of monolithic architecture. This article also uses a lot more jargon that's a little hard to follow. The impression I'm getting is that monolithic is a lot simpler and easy to pull off as long as you're keeping it small and that microservice is more complex and deals with APIs and multiple branches of units/services. This article also seems to have the opinion that microservice is better because at the end they list a bunch of advantages that it has that monolithic doesn't. These include a superiority in agility, efficiency, resiliency, and revenue.</p>
<h3>Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture(DEV)</h3>
<p>Finally an article that gives a real life example. The discussion about reliability in microservice and how if something goes wrong you can shut down one part of the app instead of the whole thing finally clicked for me. It is safe to say that microservice is the superior architecture due to its flexibility and complexity. These are also its downsides as you really need to know what you're doing if you take the microservice route.</p>
<h3>Microservices Introduction (Monolithic vs. Microservice Architecture)</h3>
<p>This article flat out tells you that microservice is better and how it overcomes the issues that monolithic has. After reading all 4 of these articles I would still like to see real life examples of apps that are each different architecture. It would additionally be helpful to see how each is implemented. From what I've read it sounds like the contract for our final project will have to be monolithic as we are not dealing with a bunch of APIs and other services. I hope to be able to create an application that uses microservice architecture some day but that doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon.</p>
